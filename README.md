# Student-Onboarding-Analysis-in-Tableau-Project
Project Overview: Student Onboarding Analysis in Tableau
Objective
The primary goal of this project is to create an interactive dashboard in Tableau to analyze and visualize onboarding survey data from students using an e-learning platform. The dashboard will provide insights into how students discover the platform, their learning goals, and career aspirations, along with trends over time and geographical distribution.

Key Concepts
Onboarding Survey: A questionnaire to capture new users' experiences, expectations, and feedback during their initial interaction with the platform.
Data Visualization: Utilizing Tableau to create visual representations of the data, making it easier to understand and derive actionable insights.
Interactive Dashboard: A dynamic tool allowing users to interact with the data through filters and other controls.
Analysis Focus
Survey Completion Trends: Track how survey completion rates vary over time and across different countries.
Discovery of Platform: Visualize the methods by which students discovered the e-learning platform.
Learning Areas: Highlight the subjects or skills students are interested in learning.
Career Goals: Illustrate the ultimate career objectives of the students.
Implementation Details
Software: Tableau Public v4. 2022 or newer.
Data Preparation: Clean and prepare the survey data for analysis.
Visualization Creation: Design various charts and graphs to represent the key analysis focus areas.
Interactivity: Implement filters for registration date, survey completion date, student country, subscription status, and type.
Dashboard Components
Time Series Analysis: Line charts showing survey completion trends over time.
Geographical Distribution: Maps indicating survey responses from different countries.
Discovery Methods: Bar charts or pie charts displaying how students discovered the platform.
Learning Interests: Visualizations (e.g., word clouds, bar charts) representing the areas students wish to learn.
Career Goals: Charts showing the distribution of students' career aspirations.
Interactive Filters
Registration Date: Filter data based on when students registered on the platform.
Survey Completion Date: Filter data based on when surveys were completed.
Student Country: View data specific to certain countries.
Subscription Status: Analyze data by free or premium subscription status.
Subscription Type: Further filter by different types of subscriptions if applicable.
Learning Outcomes
Data Visualization Skills: Enhance your ability to use Tableau for creating insightful visualizations.
Interactive Dashboard Design: Learn to build dynamic dashboards with interactive filters.
Analytical Thinking: Develop the ability to interpret and analyze survey data to uncover meaningful insights.
User Experience: Understand the importance of user feedback in improving platform experience and functionality.
This project will provide a comprehensive understanding of the onboarding process for students on an e-learning platform, enabling stakeholders to make data-driven decisions to enhance user experience and satisfaction.
